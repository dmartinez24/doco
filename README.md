# Welcome to Doco

Doco is a documentation website generator for your projects written in Go. It takes a folder with markdown files and generates a deployable static website.

## Installation

```sh
go install github.com/paganotoni/doco@latest
```

From there you can use the `doco` cli to generate a static website from your markdown files. For more info take a look at [doco's website](https://doco.antoniopagano.com). After all, would it be any point in having Markdown docs if we can generate a website with Doco?

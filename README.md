# Welcome to Doco

Doco is a documentation website generator for your projects written in Go. It takes a folder with markdown files and generates a deployable static website.

## Installation

```sh
go install github.com/paganotoni/doco@latest
```
## Usage

The Doco CLI has a few commands that will help you generate the static website from your markdown files. To get started you can run the following command:

```sh
doco init [name]
```
This will create the `docs` folder with a few basic files.

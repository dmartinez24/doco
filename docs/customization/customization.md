Doco ships with a set of defaults, however there are some basic customizations you can make to the theme to brand it to your product or project. This is an important step to make your documentation feel like it belongs to your product.

The following customizations are available:
- Logo
- Copy
- Announcement Banner
- Navigation (order)

All of these are done through the `_meta.md` file at the root of the documentation folder. This file is a markdown file that contains a set of key/value pairs that are used to customize the theme.

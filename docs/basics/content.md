The content section is probably the most important part of the documentation site. It is the place where the content is displayed. Content is converted from markdown to HTML and displayed in the main content section. It looks like this:

![Content](<../assets/content.png>)

Content can include:
- Links
- Images
- Videos

And is formatted by doco accordingly.

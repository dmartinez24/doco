The Doco CLI is the one in charge of generating the static website from the markdown files. It can come very handy when writing the documentation for your project since it will allow you to see the changes in real time.

To install the Doco CLI you can run the following command:

```sh
go install github.com/paganotoni/doco@latest
```

This will install the Doco CLI in your `$GOPATH/bin` folder. You can also download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/paganotoni/doco/releases).
